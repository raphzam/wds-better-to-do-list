HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# new concepts learned
Git: better commit messages, branches, merging
HTML: template tags, 
CSS: grid, pseudo elements, environment variables, transitions, bem naming conventions
JavaScript: queryselectors, working with browser local storage, event listeners

# takeaways
It was interesting to see how much you can create with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript without the use of any libraries or frameworks.
Looking forward to creating and styling my own to-do-list with the concepts I learned while building this project.
